An incredibly simple python script to extract song-artist pairs from the chapters of a YouTube video and export it to a .txt file where it can be easily converted to a Spotify/Apple Music playlist using tools like TuneMyMusic etc. 

For ease of use, add the file path as an alias to your ~/.bashrc for quick use.
